I have recently completed my MA in Applied Economics, with a strong focus on Econometrics and its real-world applications. Throughout my academic journey, I developed the ability to analyze complex economic data and extract meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making. I am particularly passionate about applying econometric models to address practical challenges in both public and private sector contexts.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the Centre for Integral Economics, Chanakya University, where I contribute to research projects involving empirical economic analysis and policy-oriented studies.

Proficient in tools such as R, Stata, and PostgreSQL, I am skilled at working with large datasets to uncover trends, test hypotheses, and contribute to strategic outcomes. My growing expertise in quantitative methods, combined with a commitment to rigorous analysis, positions me as a valuable asset in any data-driven environment. I am currently awaiting my final results and eager to apply my knowledge in a professional setting.
