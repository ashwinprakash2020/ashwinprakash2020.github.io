Plastics have become essential materials across numerous global industries, yet their
widespread use has created significant environmental challenges. This paper will briefly
examine the journey of plastics, from the initial inventions of organic and synthetic forms to
their current ubiquitous presence. The global landscape of plastic production and trade reveals
intricate dynamics, with certain countries leading in exports and imports. The Indian plastic
industry has also experienced substantial growth, driven by increasing demand in sectors like
packaging and construction, and fuelled by e-commerce and evolving consumer needs.
However, this growth is accompanied by increasing concerns about plastic pollution,
recognized as a serious global environmental problem. This has led to a growing emphasis
on sustainable practices, reflected in various national policies and international efforts towards
a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution. Regulations such as waste management
rules and single-use plastic bans are reshaping the industry, alongside a growing focus on
recycling, bioplastics, and innovative waste management technologies. The future of the
plastics industry is thus increasingly intertwined with the pursuit of sustainability and circular
economy models to mitigate its environmental impact.
